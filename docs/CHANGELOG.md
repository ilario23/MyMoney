## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-22## [1.8.0] - October 21, 2025 üå≥

### üöÄ Major Release - Local-First Architecture### Tree View Categories & Advanced Expense Filters

This is a **complete rewrite** with breaking changes. Not compatible with v2.x.A major UX release focusing on hierarchical category visualization and powerful filtering capabilities.

### Added#### Added

#### Core Features**Category Management:**

- **RxDB Integration**: Reactive, observable database replacing Dexie.js

- **Local-First Statistics**: Client-side computation with intelligent caching- ‚úÖ Tree view with expand/collapse for hierarchical categories

- **Improved Sync Service**: Bidirectional replication protocol with RxDB- ‚úÖ Visual indentation for subcategories (8px per level depth)

- **Leader Election**: Multi-tab support with single sync leader- ‚úÖ Chevron icons (ChevronDown/ChevronRight) for expand/collapse state

- **Reactive Queries**: Automatic UI updates via RxJS subscriptions- ‚úÖ Edit parent category support with dropdown selector

- **Stats Cache Collection**: Local-only collection for computed statistics- ‚úÖ Circular reference validation with graph traversal algorithm

- ‚úÖ Category statistics badge (expense count + total amount)

#### Database- ‚úÖ Recursive rendering function for tree structure

- New RxDB schema with JSON Schema validation- ‚úÖ `buildCategoryTree()` helper to separate top-level from children

- `deleted_at` column on all tables for soft deletes- ‚úÖ `wouldCreateCircularRef()` validation to prevent infinite loops

- `updated_at` triggers for automatic timestamp updates- ‚úÖ `toggleExpand()` with Set-based state for O(1) performance

- Cleaner Supabase schema without aggregate views

- Single setup SQL file (`SETUP_v3.0.sql`) for fresh installations**Expense Filtering:**

#### Services- ‚úÖ Advanced filter panel with collapse/expand toggle

- `src/lib/rxdb.ts`: Database initialization with leader election- ‚úÖ Category dropdown filter (all categories)

- `src/lib/rxdb-schemas.ts`: Collection schemas (8 collections)- ‚úÖ Date range filter (from/to date pickers)

- `src/services/sync.service.ts`: RxDB replication protocol- ‚úÖ Amount range filter (min/max inputs in EUR)

- `src/services/stats.service.ts`: Local statistics calculation- ‚úÖ Sort by: Date, Amount, or Category

- ‚úÖ Sort order: Ascending or Descending

#### Documentation- ‚úÖ Clear filters button (X icon) with active indicator

- Complete rewrite of `TECHNICAL.md` with v3.0 architecture- ‚úÖ Multi-criteria filtering with useEffect dependencies

- New `SETUP.md` focused on fresh installations- ‚úÖ Filter toggle button (SlidersHorizontal icon)

- Updated `README.md` with local-first concepts- ‚úÖ Active filter state highlighting

- Created `SETUP_v3.0.sql` as single source of truth

#### Changed

### Changed

- **Categories Page**: Replaced flat grid with recursive tree structure

#### Breaking Changes- **Expenses Page**: Enhanced search bar with collapsible advanced filters

- **Database**: Complete schema redesign, no migration path from v2.x- **Category Edit Mode**: Added parent selector dropdown (top-level only)

- **Sync**: New replication protocol, incompatible with old sync service- **Expense Loading**: Merged with statistics aggregation for efficiency

- **Statistics**: Moved from database views to local computation

- **Dependencies**: Removed Dexie.js, added RxDB and RxJS#### Technical

#### Architecture- New state variables: `expandedCategories`, `expenseStats`, `editParentId`

- Local-first approach: app works offline by default- New filter states: `selectedCategory`, `dateFrom`, `dateTo`, `amountMin`, `amountMax`, `sortBy`, `sortOrder`

- Reactive data flow: UI updates automatically- Recursive `renderCategory(category, depth)` with React.ReactElement return type

- Client-side computation: reduced server load- Complex filtering logic with sequential application: search ‚Üí category ‚Üí date ‚Üí amount ‚Üí sort

- Leader election: only one tab syncs at a time- Graph traversal with visited Set for circular reference detection

#### Performance#### Files Changed

- Faster queries with RxDB indexes

- Instant UI updates via reactive subscriptions- `src/pages/categories.tsx` (+280 lines)

- Reduced network requests (local stats)- `src/pages/expenses.tsx` (+250 lines)

- Better offline experience- `docs/v1.8.0_RELEASE.md` (new)

- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (this file)
