# 🔐 User Profile Security & Consistency Checklist

## 📋 Schema Security Rules

### Users Table Rules

**What users CAN do**:

- ✅ **READ** their own profile (all fields)
- ✅ **UPDATE** only `display_name` field
- ✅ Trigger auto-creates profile on signup

**What users CANNOT do**:

- ❌ **UPDATE** email (immutable)
- ❌ **UPDATE** avatar_url (immutable, managed by Auth)
- ❌ **UPDATE** created_at (immutable)
- ❌ **INSERT** their own profile (trigger handles it)
- ❌ **DELETE** profile (soft-delete only via trigger)

### Immutable Fields

```sql
-- These fields CANNOT be changed after creation:
- id (UUID from Auth)
- email (from Auth)
- avatar_url (from Auth metadata)
- created_at (set at signup)
- deleted_at (soft-delete marker only)

-- Only this field CAN be changed:
- display_name (user can update this)
- updated_at (auto-updated on any change)
```

### RLS Policy Implementation

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own display_name only"
ON public.users FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = id)
WITH CHECK (
  auth.uid() = id AND
  -- Prevent modification of immutable fields
  (OLD.email = NEW.email) AND
  (OLD.avatar_url = NEW.avatar_url) AND
  (OLD.created_at = NEW.created_at)
);
```

**How it works**:

1. `USING (auth.uid() = id)` - Can only update own record
2. `WITH CHECK (...)` - Enforces that certain fields don't change
3. If any immutable field changes → UPDATE rejected

---

## ✅ Coherence Verification

### Database Schema

- ✅ `users` table has `deleted_at` (soft-delete support)
- ✅ All other tables have `deleted_at` (consistent)
- ✅ Trigger auto-creates users on auth.users INSERT
- ✅ Trigger reads `display_name` from `user_metadata`

### App Code (TypeScript)

**signup.tsx**:

- ✅ Does NOT insert user into Supabase (trigger handles it)
- ✅ Only stores to local Dexie (for offline)
- ✅ Sets `avatar_url: null` (not settable by user)

**login.tsx**:

- ✅ Does NOT check/create user (trigger handles it)
- ✅ Only reads `display_name` from `user_metadata`
- ✅ Only reads `avatar_url` from `user_metadata`
- ✅ Only stores to local Dexie (for offline)

**profile.tsx**:

- ✅ Does NOT update users table
- ✅ No calls to `supabase.from('users').update()`
- ✅ Only reads user data for display

**router.tsx**:

- ✅ Reads `avatar_url` from Auth metadata (read-only)
- ✅ Reads `display_name` from Auth metadata (read-only)

### RLS Policies

| Table           | SELECT      | INSERT       | UPDATE               | DELETE         |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------ | -------------------- | -------------- |
| **users**       | ✅ own only | ❌ (trigger) | ✅ display_name only | ❌             |
| **categories**  | ✅ own only | ✅ own only  | ✅ own only          | ❌ soft-delete |
| **expenses**    | ✅ own only | ✅ own only  | ✅ own only          | ❌ soft-delete |
| **stats_cache** | ✅ own only | ✅ own only  | ✅ own only          | ❌ soft-delete |

## 🔄 User Profile Lifecycle

### Signup Flow

```
1. User submits email + password + display_name
   ↓
2. Supabase Auth creates auth.users record
   ↓
3. Trigger on_auth_user_created fires
   ↓
4. Trigger inserts into public.users with:
   - id (from auth.uid())
   - email (from auth.email)
   - display_name (from user_metadata->>'display_name')
   - created_at, updated_at (NOW())
   ↓
5. App stores to local Dexie (for offline)
   ↓
6. User sees dashboard
```

### Update Display Name

```
User wants to change display_name:

Option 1: Via Supabase Auth metadata
  → User updates in Auth UI/API
  → Trigger on auth.users UPDATE would be needed
  → NOT currently implemented

Option 2: NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED
  → RLS policy allows UPDATE display_name in public.users
  → But app has no UI for this
  → Can be added if needed
```

### Immutable Fields

```
Cannot be changed after signup:
- Email: Use Supabase Auth email change (separate from profile)
- Avatar URL: Set via Auth metadata (user profile photo)
- ID: Inherent to Auth
- Created At: Historical marker
```

## 🛡️ Security Implications

### What's Protected

✅ **Users cannot modify email** → Prevents account takeover via profile  
✅ **Users cannot modify created_at** → Prevents data tampering  
✅ **Users cannot modify avatar_url** → Immutable, managed by Auth  
✅ **Users cannot INSERT other profiles** → Trigger prevents it  
✅ **Users cannot DELETE profiles** → Soft-delete only  
✅ **Immutable fields enforced at DB level** → Can't bypass from client

### Potential Gaps

⚠️ **display_name UPDATE currently not exposed in UI** → Users can't actually update it yet  
→ Solution: Add profile edit UI to allow display_name changes

⚠️ **avatar_url fixed to NULL** → Users can't upload avatars currently  
→ Solution: Integrate with Auth metadata update or separate file storage

---

## 📝 Future Enhancements

### If Needed (Optional)

1. **Avatar Upload**:
   - Add file storage (Supabase Storage)
   - Generate signed URL
   - Store URL in Auth metadata

2. **Display Name Edit**:
   - Create profile edit UI
   - Call Supabase to update `public.users.display_name`
   - App already allows it via RLS policy

3. **Email Change**:
   - Use Supabase Auth email change API
   - Separate from profile updates
   - Requires email verification

---

## ✅ Final Checklist

- ✅ Schema: `deleted_at` on all tables including users
- ✅ Trigger: Auto-creates users on signup
- ✅ Immutable Fields: Cannot be modified after creation
- ✅ RLS Policy: Enforces immutability at DB level
- ✅ App Code: No attempts to modify immutable fields
- ✅ App Code: No direct INSERT into users table
- ✅ App Code: No direct UPDATE of users table
- ✅ Build: 0 errors
- ✅ All tables: RLS enabled and policies created
